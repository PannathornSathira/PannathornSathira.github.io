My first volunteer experience at university began with an event called First-Meet, where we were responsible for taking care of junior students and coordinating with staff. I worked as part of the area team, focusing on maintaining safety across multiple event locations. This role helped me develop essential skills such as teamwork and communication, especially when working with people from different departments.

Later, during Baan'Day, I collaborated with the welfare team to manage food and drink logistics for the event. We had to estimate the number of attendees and consider dietary restrictions and preferences. I learned how important it is to be attentive and respectful to individual needsâ€”such as food allergies or religious dietary requirements, like avoiding pork for Muslim participants. These experiences broadened my perspective and helped me become more open-minded, empathetic, and understanding of others.
