As the CPE class president, I was responsible for organizing faculty-wide activities that brought our student community together. I led the planning and execution of two major events: "CPE First Meet," an orientation program to welcome new students, and a "Data Structure Competition" aimed at enhancing academic engagement. In both events, I worked on both the ดront and backstage—handling everything from communicating with participants and promoting the event to managing logistics, setting up systems, and coordinating with various teams behind the scenes. I had to work closely with many people, including faculty staff, sponsors, and fellow students, which taught me how to adapt my communication style, resolve conflicts, and stay organized under pressure. These experiences helped me grow significantly as a leader and a team player.
