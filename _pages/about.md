I am a student studying Computer engineer at SIIT, Thammasat University. I am interesting everything in technology world especially AI, ML and Block-chain. My ambition is to help the world to be better by using my tech skills.

I have knowledge about all basic python and java from my class at a university. Moreover, I can implement python to use ML when I was an internship at NECTEC. Additionally, I can use HTML/ CSS and Java script that I learned from 42 bangkok discovery piscience. Lastly, I am learning more about back-end languages such as PHP SQL.

I am excited about opportunities and challenges that allow me to utilize my proficiency and leverage my existing learnings.
