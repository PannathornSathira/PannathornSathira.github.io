# Main Story

In the heart of the Pig Kingdom lies the Pig Queen, a powerful and benevolent ruler whose magic keeps the land in harmony. But one fateful day, the Final Boss (Temp name), a malevolent entity from a dark realm, strikes the Pig Queen with a devastating blow. As the Queen falls, her soul is shattered into four fragments, each representing a piece of her power and essence.

The fragments scatter across the kingdom, each piece guarded by a formidable boss who was once loyal to the Queen but is now corrupted by the dark magic of the Final Boss. The kingdom plunges into chaos as the Queen's influence wanes, and the once-peaceful lands are overrun by darkness.

As the chosen hero, it is your duty to restore the Pig Queen’s soul and save the kingdom. You must journey through the four distinct areas of the kingdom, each with its unique challenges and dangers. In each area, you will face a powerful boss corrupted by the darkness, guarding a fragment of the Queen’s soul. With each victory, a piece of the Queen's essence is restored, bringing hope back to the land.

But the journey doesn’t end there. Once you’ve collected the four soul fragments, you realize that you require a mystical potion capable of reviving the Pig Queen which is guarded by the true challenge: the Final Boss. In the climactic battle, you must defeat this ultimate evil to claim the mystical potion and in combination with all of the Queen’s soul can the Pig Queen be revived, restoring peace and order to the kingdom.

The fate of the kingdom rests in your hands. Will you be able to conquer the darkness, restore the Queen, and bring light back to the land?

# Technical details
This project utilizes the Python-based Pygame library to create an interactive 2D game experience. It is built with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making the codebase modular, maintainable, and scalable. Core game elements—such as characters, enemies, projectiles, and environments—are represented through well-defined classes that encapsulate both behavior and state.

The game loop is structured around Pygame’s event-driven architecture, with efficient update and render cycles that manage user input, physics, collision detection, animation states, and level progression. In addition, the project implements a custom state management system for game scenes, allowing seamless transitions between the main menu, gameplay, pause, and game-over screens.

Graphics and sprite animations are loaded and managed using sprite sheets, while sound effects and music are integrated to enhance immersion. The project also features basic AI for enemy behavior, modular level design, and a rudimentary UI system for health bars, inventory, and score tracking.
